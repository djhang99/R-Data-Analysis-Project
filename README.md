# NYC Data Academy Project 2 - (Analyzing Suicide Rates to better understand Mental Health)

## Project Description
Mental Health is rapidly growing worldwide and has in the past few years recently hit mainstream media.  I wanted to take a closer look into the suicide rates to see if there was a way to measure and quantify that growth and see which age group, gender, country/region are experiencing the most rapid growth.

## Goal
Suicide prevention is a multi-sector issue.  It involves health care professionals, government welfare, politicans and expands all the way to patients, caregivers and family members.  I wanted to better understand the data presented to help visually represent this issue so that it could spread awareness to all these involved parties.
